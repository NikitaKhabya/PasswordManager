# PasswordManager
Hey you all, I hope you are doing great! Today I have managed to create a password manager GUI which lets you store and retrieve your passwords at various sites. This asks for the website you want to store the password of,  the email/username, and the password you want to set. Alternatively there is a generate password button which generates a random password that satisfies all the constraints requiered for a password like capital letter/symbol etc. Then once typed or generated the password it adds it to a text file, of which you will have access anytime you want. This is totally on your desktop without involvement of any third party. So just have a look and run it on your pc also let me know your reviews.
